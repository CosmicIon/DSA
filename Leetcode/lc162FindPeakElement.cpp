// Leetcode 162. Find Peak Element

// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

        int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
            int s = 0;
            int e = nums.size()-1;
            while(s<e) {
                int mid = s + (e-s)/2;
    
                if(nums[mid]>nums[mid+1]) {
                    e = mid;
                }
                else {
                    s = mid + 1;
                }
